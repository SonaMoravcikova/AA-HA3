# Molecular Activity Prediction Using Machine Learning (School Project)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for inferring molecular activity over the Dopamine2 Receptors. The task is a regression problem where regression models are utilized to predict molecular activity. The dataset is provided via Python Pickle (drd2_data.pickle) and consists of training data (X_train, y_train) and independent variables (X_ivs) for which predictions are to be made.

## Dataset
The dataset is acquired using Python Pickle and consists of the following components:
- **X_train**: Training data features
- **y_train**: Training data target labels
- **X_ivs**: Independent variables for prediction
- **col_names**: Column names (features) of the dataset

## Objective
The objective is to produce the best estimators for predicting molecular activity (y_ivs) based on the independent variables (X_ivs).
